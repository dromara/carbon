# Format signs
`Format` and `ParseByFormat` methods are not completely reversible. `Format` method supports all of the following signs, while `ParseByFormat` method does not support `K`, `W`, `N`, `L`, `w`, `t`, `o`, `q`, `c` because these signs are custom and do not have corresponding signs in the standard time package.
