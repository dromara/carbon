# Overview

`Carbon` is a lightweight, semantic, and developer-friendly `golang` time package that doesn't depend on `any` third-party package, has `100%` unit test coverage, and has been used by [docker](https://github.com/docker/docker-language-server/blob/main/go.mod#L10 "docker") organization as well as included by [awesome-go](https://github.com/yinggaozhen/awesome-go-cn#日期和时间 "awesome-go-cn") and [hello-github](https://hellogithub.com/repository/dromara/carbon "hello-github").

## Feature
- Lightweight & zero dependency：pure `go` implementation, doesn't depend on `any` third-party package, `100%` unit test coverage
- Semantic API: provide concise and elegant chain calls with high readability, ensuring code scalability and reusability
- Powerful time manipulation：support time resolution, time addition and subtraction, time setting, time boundary, time judgment, etc
- Rich time retrieve：retrieve each parts of time (such as year, month, day, hour, minute, second, etc.) and timestamp
- Diversified output format：output time strings of different precision and formats as needed, including ISO8601, RFC series, and custom formats
- Test friendly：support setting test time, freezes current time, facilitates unit testing
- Time zone handling：support setting and obtaining time zones, as well as converting between different time zones
- I18N：support over 30 localized translation languages and allow customization of translation resources
- Error handling：provide error checking mechanism for handling errors such as time resolution
